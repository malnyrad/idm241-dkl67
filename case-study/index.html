                <h2>The Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was focused on improving a set of microinteractions to enhance the experience of the Timetree calendar sidebar for IDM 241 (Microinteractions). For this solo project, the goal was to redesign the existing microinteractions (or lack thereof) of a certain part of a website of our choosing using Figma and front-end scripting languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Over the course of the 10-week term, I designed and developed three iterations, referred to as builds in this project, that focused on engagement, brand identity, and adherence to animation principles. The final build included refined hover effects and on-click animations that built off of the existing structure of the website, as well as details regarding triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes to better illustrate the front- and back-end of each microinteraction.</p>

                <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
                <p>This project was created for IDM-241 Microinteractions. Over the course of 10 weeks, the purpose of this solo project was to redesign a set of microinteractions within a website of our choosing; for this project, I selected Timetree, a social calendar app. With this in mind, my primary goals were to redesign parts of the sidebar of a Timetree calendar and incorporate not only functional, but improved microinteractions that enhanced user engagement and overall experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Due to the nature of the course, the project was carried out under a strict 10-week schedule and required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the languages to develop our builds. Following the existing branding guidelines for Timetree, I gradually incorporated more microinteractions and a larger part of the sidebar's functionality throughout my successive builds.</p>
