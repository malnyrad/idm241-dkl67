                <h2>The Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was focused on improving a set of microinteractions to enhance the experience of the Timetree calendar sidebar for IDM 241 (Microinteractions). For this solo project, the goal was to redesign the existing microinteractions (or lack thereof) of a certain part of a website of our choosing using Figma and front-end scripting languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Over the course of the 10-week term, I designed and developed three iterations, referred to as builds in this project, that focused on engagement, brand identity, and adherence to animation principles. The final build included refined hover effects and on-click animations that built off of the existing structure of the website, as well as details regarding triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes to better illustrate the front- and back-end of each microinteraction.</p>

                <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
                <p>This project was created for IDM-241 Microinteractions. Over the course of 10 weeks, the purpose of this solo project was to redesign a set of microinteractions within a website of our choosing; for this project, I selected Timetree, a social calendar app. With this in mind, my primary goals were to redesign parts of the sidebar of a Timetree calendar and incorporate not only functional, but improved microinteractions that enhanced user engagement and overall experience.
                <br><br>
                Due to the nature of the course, the project was carried out under a strict 10-week schedule and required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the languages to develop our builds. Following the existing branding guidelines for Timetree, I gradually incorporated more microinteractions and a larger part of the sidebar's functionality throughout my successive builds.</p>

                <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
                <h3>Alpha</h3>
                <p>The project began with analyzing Timetree's current calendar sidebar and identifying its existing microinteractions. This constituted the alpha build, where I described and recreated the base sidebar that would serve as the starting point for the more complex interactions in future builds. In my description, based off of the existing content on Timetree, I found that the base sidebar had microinteractions that were triggered by hovering over each icon box as well as clicking on them. These triggers provided the basis for the rules, including the tagline appearing, hover colors, and hover elements. Since these microinteractions had no backend processes, the feedback (changes visible to the user) remained the same as the rules. The modes that would appear were the side panel and the popup, depending on which icon box was selected.</p>
                <h3>Beta</h3>
                <p>The beta build was the beginning of my ideation for improvements to the existing Timetree microinteractions. While I struggled to decide on what aspects to include and refine in the build, I eventually focused on the two main parts that would have sub-interactions that I could build upon later. These were the expanding side panel of the "Memo" icon box and the popup of the "Members" icon box and also made up the modes of the sidebar overall. With this in mind, I began outlining the interaction flows by making mockups in Figma in order to better visualize the different triggers and feedback. These mockups, shown below, served as guidelines to help me figure out my coding goals.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, the beta build also included descriptions of all triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes of the new microinteractions, focusing on the side panel and the popup. While the beta was primarily coded using HTML and CSS not unlike the alpha build, I started incorporating JavaScript to allow for certain functionality, such as the expanding and collapsing side panel.</p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>At the end of the 10-week iterative process, I ended up with the final build, which consists of the isolated calendar sidebar with the first two icon boxes ("Memo" and "Members") faithfully recreated with improved microinteractions. The microinteractions included in this build are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Icon Sidebar ("Memo") - Default/Active</li>
                    <li>Icon Sidebar ("Members") - Default/Active</li>
                    <li>Popup ("Members") - Member Listing</li>
                    <li>Popup ("Members") - Member Profile</li>
                    <li>Popup ("Members") - Toggle Button - Default/Inactive</li>
                    <li>Popup ("Members") - Copy Link</li>
                </ul>
